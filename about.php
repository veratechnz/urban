               <p>Here at Urban Calm Yin Yoga Centre we are passionate about helping people of all body types 
               and sizes find more space and harmony in their bodies. Yin yoga is the oldest form of Yoga. 
               In Yin we exercise the connective tissue, joints and ligaments by spending three minutes or 
               more in one pose.</p>  
               <p> The connective tissue is like plastic in fibre so it requires time to open (explaining the need for long holds.) 
               This is when Yin becomes fascinating as each minute goes by, we feel the body open naturally - breathing into the tension and then exhaling to find that we have more space. With each breath the body sinks a little deeper.
               Please use our online booking system to book your class today.</p>

            <p>After travelling the world, Faye is relishing the chance to be home and celebrating what New Zealand 
            and Dunedin has to offer. When photographer Marelda O’Rourke Gallaher and Faye were creating new images 
            for Urban Calm, it only made sense to celebrate some of Faye’s favourite things about Dunedin. The 
            beautiful new photographs show Faye in classic Yin poses in front of some of Dunedin’s iconic street 
            art, and wearing Silkbody clothing.</p>

            <p>When explaining why she chooses to Yin in Silkbody, Faye says, “I love to Yin in Silkbody as in Yin 
            it feels like you go back to beginning of self, back to the cocoon that is home. Yin is a time to 
            check in and Silkbody sets that feeling in the truest form of delicate comfort - Yin is a time to 
            give back to self and you know you are truly giving back to self when you dress in Silkbody.”</p>

            <p>Urban Calm seeks to be a safe haven in a harsh world and Faye’s vision certainly seems to be coming 
            to life. We’re happy that Silkbody fits so perfectly into this vision - it’s great to know that our 
            beautiful garments are being embraced and appreciated on so many levels. If you’re ever in Dunedin, 
            we can recommend taking pause at Urban Calm. In Faye’s wise words - “slow down, take a breath and 
            rethink in order to speed up”.</p>

            <p>Faye Winmill opened Urban Calm Yin Yoga Centre earlier this year, she was hoping to create a space 
            where people could ‘switch off’ from life and tune in to their bodies. Safe, calm, warm and friendly, 
            an environment where yoga wasn’t a competition or an exercise in sweat-gathering, but a deep breath 
            of fresh air in the rat race of city life. Faye says, “I wanted to create a place where everything 
            could be stopped even just for an hour. A place for people to give themselves permission to let all 
            the things go that have been holding them back in their minds and in their lives.”</p>
            
            <p>And the moment you walk through the high glass doors, you get the feeling Faye is creating 
            just that. Nestled in Dunedin’s historic precinct, The Exchange, Urban Calm is in a beautifully 
            renovated brick building, complete with high ceilings and large windows allowing maximum natural 
            light to filter into the studio. It’s minimal yet inviting so that even the aesthetic part of your 
            brain gets a nice little holiday - even the yoga mats and supports are colour co-ordinated. Faye is 
            also proud to offer Urban Calm as a Training Centre of Higher Learning where she intends to bring 
            international teachers to continue to help people grow and learn on their life journey.</p>
