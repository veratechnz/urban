               <p>Here at Urban Calm Yin Yoga Centre Dunedin we are passionate about helping people of all body types 
               and sizes find more space and harmony in their bodies. Yin yoga is the oldest form of Yoga. 
               In Yin we exercise the connective tissue, joints and ligaments by spending three minutes or 
               more in one pose.</p>  
               <p> The connective tissue is like plastic in fibre so it requires time to open (explaining the need for long holds.) 
               This is when Yin becomes fascinating as each minute goes by, we feel the body open naturally - breathing into the tension and then exhaling to find that we have more space. With each breath the body sinks a little deeper.

                <p>Faye Winmill is the founder of Urban Calm Dunedin Yin Yoga Centre. 
                Having practiced different forms of yoga for 10 years prior to committing 
                herself to teaching, she decided to gain her certification in 2013 and studied 
                at the Pavones Yoga Centre in Costa Rica. Her time in the jungle saw her obtain 
                the 200 hour Yoga Alliance Certificate in Multi-dimentional Training as well as the 108 hour 
                Certificate in Art of Flow Vinyassa and Integrative healing Yoga Therapy.</p>

                <p>Faye has a passion for introducing people to yoga and its benefits. She is 
                committed to her belief that postures as simple as dangling and kneeling will 
                help maintain mental and physical health, help us to open our bodies and minds 
                and play a significant  part in preventing many common diseases. Conditions such 
                as arthritis and other joint problems see huge improvements with Yin Yoga and 
                regular practice may even prevent us from needing (or drastically delay any future 
                need) for joint replacements.</p>

              <h4>YIN YOGA DUNEDIN AND URBAN CALM</h4>
              <p>Yin Yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga with poses (asanas) that are held for longer periods of time than in other styles—three 
              to five minutes or even as long as twenty minutes is common. Yin asanas apply moderate and controlled stress to the connective tissues 
              (the tendons, fascia and ligaments) with the aim of improving  flexibility and increasing circulation and hydration of the joints. 
              As a slow, meditative and holistic practice Yin also cultivates a profound bodily and inner awareness, a silence, calm and equanimity 
              which brings a peaceful interconnection to otherwise fragmented contemporary lifestyles.</p>

              <p>At Urban Calm Yin Yoga Dunedin we recognise that life (particularly contemporary urban life) has become fragmented and supersaturated with time pressures and performance demands.
               We all seem to be going at a hundred miles an hour, flitting from one activity or responsibility to the next. 
              This is not necessarily a bad thing: fulfilment can come from those activities and achievements at work and in social 
              and family life and an active body and mind is a good thing. But when all of these active elements of our lives take over 
              completely we are likely to fall out of balance. Tao philosophy would interpret this situation as one where the “Yang” forces 
              (changing, mobile, masculine, active, hot, and upward moving) have overwhelmed the “Yin” (stable, immobile, feminine, passive, 
              cold, and downward moving). We all need balance. Urban Calm is that place where we can come to restore that balance, to find ourselves, to rejuvenate.</p>

              <p>At Urban Calm we believe that when you stop and take time to open your body, to relax your muscles and find the deeper 
              connective tissues you are also finding a deeply holistic reconciliation. The slow pace of Yin and its meditative 
              foundations open us to ourselves. As our bodily awareness grows we relearn our very selves. In this deep holistic 
              relaxation which brings us face to face with our bodies, our minds and our spirits, we find an 'inner teacher'.</p>
              <hr>

              <h4 class="voffset">OUR INTUITIVE APPROACH TO YIN</h4>
              <p>At Urban Calm we are committed to helping you find this inner teacher. Everybody, every mind is different. 
              Because we each have our own peculiar skeletal structures and our own peculiar bodily forms we do not prescribe how a 
              pose should be done. Finding the pose is always an absolutely singular and individual experience, dependent on individual 
              idiosyncrasies and body shapes – it is INTUITIVE and the intuition is always yours. We do not think a pose 'looks like' 
              anything in particular – it is instead always a matter of you finding your 'inner teacher', learning your own limitations 
              and feeling and intuiting how things need to be. At Urban Calm we will guide you to your own intuition: we will never 
              correct or adjust you nor will we force you into any idealised image or pose.</p>
              <hr>

              <h4 class="voffset">EYES WIDE SHUT</h4>
              <p>Our intuitive approach goes deeper than simply abandoning forceful 'correction' or adjustment – we 
              try to abandon all those objectifying habits and thought processes which set us against ourselves. 
              When we compare ourselves to an image we are breaking ourselves in two - into an ideal image on the one 
              hand and a reality failing to meet the demands of that ideal on the other. It is a judgemental structure which 
              is imposed by all of society's objectifying processes and by a self-consciousness which is always second guessing 
              ourselves. Structures of judgment, objectification and competitiveness go against the very holistic nature of Yin 
              practice.</p>

              <p>At Urban Calm we therefore aim to  provide an absolutely non-objectifying and non-judgemental space. 
              We want you to be and feel integrated, to feel and be whole, so you can be comfortable and find your inner teacher 
              without the anxieties of self-consciousness. We therefore teach with our eyes closed but our awareness open. 
              Teaching with 'eyes wide shut'  helps us towards an inner focus, awareness and intuition and meshes well with our 
              no-correction/ no-adjustment technique. By teaching with our eyes closed we hope to give you the privacy and space 
              you need to find your own inner focus and your own intuition. Many beginners find the prospect of judgement and being 
              stared at a barrier to their practice, and even experienced practitioners can be distracted by objectifications.</p>
