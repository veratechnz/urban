               <p>Here at Urban Calm Yin Yoga Centre we are passionate about helping people of all body types 
               and sizes find more space and harmony in their bodies. Yin yoga is the oldest form of Yoga. 
               In Yin we exercise the connective tissue, joints and ligaments by spending three minutes or 
               more in one pose.</p>  
               <p> The connective tissue is like plastic in fibre so it requires time to open (explaining the need for long holds.) 
               This is when Yin becomes fascinating as each minute goes by, we feel the body open naturally - breathing into the tension and then exhaling to find that we have more space. With each breath the body sinks a little deeper.

            <p>After travelling the world, Faye is relishing the chance to be home and celebrating what New Zealand 
            and Dunedin has to offer. When photographer Marelda O’Rourke Gallaher and Faye were creating new images 
            for Urban Calm, it only made sense to celebrate some of Faye’s favourite things about Dunedin. The 
            beautiful new photographs show Faye in classic Yin poses in front of some of Dunedin’s iconic street 
            art, and wearing Silkbody clothing.</p>

            <p>When explaining why she chooses to Yin in Silkbody, Faye says, “I love to Yin in Silkbody as in Yin 
            it feels like you go back to beginning of self, back to the cocoon that is home. Yin is a time to 
            check in and Silkbody sets that feeling in the truest form of delicate comfort - Yin is a time to 
            give back to self and you know you are truly giving back to self when you dress in Silkbody.”</p>

            <p>Urban Calm seeks to be a safe haven in a harsh world and Faye’s vision certainly seems to be coming 
            to life. We’re happy that Silkbody fits so perfectly into this vision - it’s great to know that our 
            beautiful garments are being embraced and appreciated on so many levels. If you’re ever in Dunedin, 
            we can recommend taking pause at Urban Calm. In Faye’s wise words - “slow down, take a breath and 
            rethink in order to speed up”.</p>

              <h4>YIN YOGA AND URBAN CALM</h4>
              <p>Yin Yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga with poses (asanas) that are held for longer periods of time than in other styles—three 
                to five minutes or even as long as twenty minutes is common. Yin asanas apply moderate and controlled stress to the connective tissues 
                (the tendons, fascia and ligaments) with the aim of improving  flexibility and increasing circulation and hydration of the joints. 
                As a slow, meditative and holistic practice Yin also cultivates a profound bodily and inner awareness, a silence, calm and equanimity 
                which brings a peaceful interconnection to otherwise fragmented contemporary lifestyles.</p>

              <p>At Urban Calm we recognise that life (particularly contemporary urban life) has become fragmented and supersaturated with time pressures and performance demands.
               We all seem to be going at a hundred miles an hour, flitting from one activity or responsibility to the next. 
              This is not necessarily a bad thing: fulfilment can come from those activities and achievements at work and in social 
              and family life and an active body and mind is a good thing. But when all of these active elements of our lives take over 
              completely we are likely to fall out of balance. Tao philosophy would interpret this situation as one where the “Yang” forces 
              (changing, mobile, masculine, active, hot, and upward moving) have overwhelmed the “Yin” (stable, immobile, feminine, passive, 
              cold, and downward moving). We all need balance. Urban Calm is that place where we can come to restore that balance, to find ourselves, to rejuvinate.</p>

              <p>At Urban Calm we believe that when you stop and take time to open your body, to relax your muscles and find the deeper 
              connective tissues you are also finding a deeply holistic reconciliation. The slow pace of Yin and its meditative 
              foundations open us to ourselves. As our bodily awareness grows we relearn our very selves. In this deep holistic 
              relaxation which brings us face to face with our bodies, our minds and our spirits, we find an 'inner teacher'.</p>

              <h4 class="voffset">OUR INTUITIVE APPROACH TO YIN</h4>
              <p>At Urban Calm we are committed to helping you find this inner teacher. Every body, every mind is different. 
              Because we each have our own peculiar skeletal structures and our own peculiar bodily forms we do not prescribe how a 
              pose should be done. Finding the pose is always an absolutely singular and individual experience, dependent on individual 
              idiosyncracies and body shapes – it is INTUITIVE and the intuition is always yours. We do not think a pose 'looks like' 
              anything in particular – it is instead always a matter of you finding your 'inner teacher', learning your own limitations 
              and feeling and intuiting how things need to be. At Urban Calm we will guide you to your own intuition: we will never 
              correct or adjust you nor will we force you into any idealised image or pose.</p>

              <h4 class="voffset">EYES WIDE SHUT</h4>
              <p>Our intuitive approach goes deeper than simply abandoning forceful 'correction' or adjustment – we 
              try to abandon all those objectifying habits and thought processes which set us against ourselves. 
              When we compare ourselves to an image we are breaking ourselves in two - into an ideal image on the one 
              hand and a reality failing to meet the demands of that ideal on the other. It is a judgemental structure which 
              is imposed by all of society's objectifying processes and by a self-consciousness which is always second guessing 
              ourselves. Structures of judgment, objectification and competitiveness go against the very holistic nature of Yin 
              practice.</p>

              <p>At Urban Calm we therefore aim to  provide an absolutely non-objectifying and non-judgemental space. 
              We want you to be and feel integrated, to feel and be whole, so you can be comfortable and find your inner teacher 
              without the anxieties of self-consciousness. We therefore teach with our eyes closed but our awareness open. 
              Teaching with 'eyes wide shut'  helps us towards an inner focus, awareness and intuition and meshes well with our 
              no-correction/ no-adjustment technique. By teaching with our eyes closed we hope to give you the privacy and space 
              you need to find your own inner focus and your own intuition. Many beginners find the prospect of judgement and being 
              stared at a barrier to their practice, and even experienced practitioners can be distracted by objectifications.</p>
