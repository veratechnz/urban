               <p>The Purpose of Yin Yoga is to restore the body to its natural state of health and to actualise our
                ability to move with fluidity, power and grace. Like all forms of yoga, Yin is a holistic practice. 
                This does not mean it is 'mystical', simply that it simultaneously exercises the body AND the mind, 
                the subjective AND the objective, and  reconciles the individual with the world in which s/he lives 
                serving to re-balance life.</p> 
                <p>Paulie Zink, one of the key figures in its modern rediscovery, tells us 
                that "Yin yoga is an art form, not an exact science", but this does not mean that its healing benefits 
                are not demonstrable (there is good evidence, scientific and anecdotal for many of the healing benefits), 
                simply that its benefits and practice goes beyond the limitations of  mechanistic thinking and relate to mental, 
                bodily and spiritual health. </p>

          <p>In Yin we want to relax the muscles in order to get the true stress of the connective tissue - so first 
          we must soften the mind which generally requires us letting go of the daily stresses and 'have tos'. 
          Contemporary, urban lifestyles are full of activity; full of deadlines, jobs, responsibilities and 
          pressures on both body and mind - what Taoist philosophy would term the 'Yang.'   At Urban Calm we have 
          created a space in which to slow down, breathe and rebalance our lives. In Taoist terminology, the active 
          Yang part of existence is over-emphasized by our current social structures - at Urban Calm we believe that the 
          soothing, accepting and peaceful style of Yin yoga will be endlessly beneficial in re-establishing harmony in 
          body, mind and spirit.</p>

          <p>The human nervous system actually functions in two different ways according to two basic systems, the somatic and 
          autonomic nervous systems. The conscious activities, choices and movements  are controlled by the somatic system: 
          when we decide to move or act in any way, it is the somatic system that makes it happen. This is the more 'yang' 
          aspect of our nervous system. In contrast the autonomic system operates by itself and keeps the organism's fundamental
          basic functions in order by controlling such things as heart rate, digestion, respiration, and circulation.</p>

          <p>The autonomic system is itself divided into two: the parasympathetic and the sympathetic functions. The sympathetic 
          system controls our “fight and flight” response, so that when we feel unsafe or threatened we automatically move into 
          our sympathetic system. A number of physical changes in the body take place in when the sympathetic nervous system is 
          agitated in this way: the blood pressure rises, the immune system is modulated, the adrenal system is activated,  the 
          digestive system shuts down, and blood is sent to the big muscles of the legs. This puts strain on the body, which may 
          well be necessary for its survival, feelings of danger might emerge from immediate threats: a lion charging, a car 
          heading toward us in the wrong lane, or the prospect of job losses at work. But the overactivity of the sympathetic 
          nervous system  can have detrimental long-term effects. Dr Timothy McCall, author of the book Yoga as Medicine has 
          even claimed that 'Stress is the number one killer in the Western world today ... stress fuels some of the biggest 
          health problems of our time, including type 2 diabetes, depression, osteoporosis, heart attacks and strokes as well 
          as autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis. While there isn't a lot of evidence 
          that stress causes cancer, it appears to increase the odds of dying from the disease."  When a busy stressful lifestyle 
          sets these 'fight or flight' processes into chronic motion they can fall out of their proper balance and lead lead us to suffer from 
          stress, anxiety, depression and lead our bodies to hold this tension in ways that no longer serve us positively.</p>

          <p>The parasympathetic system, often known for its "rest and digest" functions, is where we go to rest and renew ourselves. 
          It is the natural, non-agitated, state of the nervous system: when it's working properly we feel safe in our lives and find 
          the space to feel that our life is in balance. In physiological terms, contemporary lifestyles tend to lead to 
          hyperactive sypathethic nervous systems and hypoactive parasympathetic systems: Yin Yoga and its focus on mindful 
          breathing, muscle relaxation and its working of connective tissue can drastically reduce our stress levels, restore 
          the balance between sypathetic and parasympathetic systems and reduce and remove many of the detrimental, stress 
          related conditions which plague modern lifestyles. Harmony, equanimity, balance and full bodily health is not possible 
          when we are stuck in our flight and fight response and every effort is aimed at survival, at making it through another 
          day: Yin yoga can help us make the shift from 'fight' to 'restore', from 'fear' to 'peace,' and from 'flight' to 
          'reconciliation.'</p>
