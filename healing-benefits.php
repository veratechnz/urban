               <p>The Purpose of Yin Yoga is to restore the body to its natural state of health and to actualise our
                ability to move with fluidity, power and grace. Like all forms of yoga, Yin is a holistic practice. 
                This does not mean it is 'mystical', simply that it simultaneously exercises the body AND the mind, 
                the subjective AND the objective, and  reconciles the individual with the world in which s/he lives 
                serving to re-balance life.</p> 
                <p>Paulie Zink, one of the key figures in its modern rediscovery, tells us 
                that "Yin yoga is an art form, not an exact science", but this does not mean that its healing benefits 
                are not demonstrable (there is good evidence, scientific and anecdotal for many of the healing benefits), 
                simply that its benefits and practice goes beyond the limitations of  mechanistic thinking and relate to mental, 
                bodily and spiritual health. </p>
