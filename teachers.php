               <p>The Purpose of Yin Yoga is to restore the body to its natural state of health and to actualise our
                ability to move with fluidity, power and grace. Like all forms of yoga, Yin is a holistic practice. 
                This does not mean it is 'mystical', simply that it simultaneously exercises the body AND the mind, 
                the subjective AND the objective, and  reconciles the individual with the world in which s/he lives 
                serving to re-balance life.</p> 
                <p>Paulie Zink, one of the key figures in its modern rediscovery, tells us 
                that "Yin yoga is an art form, not an exact science", but this does not mean that its healing benefits 
                are not demonstrable (there is good evidence, scientific and anecdotal for many of the healing benefits), 
                simply that its benefits and practice goes beyond the limitations of  mechanistic thinking and relate to mental, 
                bodily and spiritual health. </p>

            <p>I'm Kimberley and I am honoured and delighted to be joining Faye and Urban Calm as a teacher 
              in October.</p>

            <p>I am a practising naturopath, massage and bodywork therapist and have had my clinic in Moray 
              Place for 10 years.  I have also studied anatomy and physiology at Otago University and taught at 
              Lotus College of Natural Therapies.  I am crazy passionate about the intelligence of the human body, 
              and working with it to cultivate health, happiness and wellbeing. I have experienced and witnessed 
              the healing that comes about when the body is given what it needs. Meditative practise, bridging mind and 
              body, is an important part of a wholistic lifestyle.  This is one of the reasons I am so drawn to yin yoga.</p>

              <p>I first discovered the joy and transformation of yoga 20 years ago, yin yoga specifically 4 years ago.  
              What particularly excites me about yin yoga it how safe and gentle it is, yet so deeply powerful and empowering.  
              It allows us the time and space to listen to self, to our body and it's inner wisdom. I believe this reflective, 
              inward practise is a perfect balm to soothe our busy out-going lifestyles.  Allowing us to come into the simple truth of the moment.</p>

              <p>Urban Calm is a beautiful sanctuary, an oasis to come and drink of whatever it is that we desire or 
              need, in the moment. To simply be....</p>

              <p>It am so looking forward to be-ing on the mat beside you, and sharing this special space.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone.</p>

              <p>I am a real newcomer to Yin and was totally hooked from the first day.
              I have had an achy body since I was very young and numerous diagnoses which gave little 
              help to overcoming that. I began to Yin in my very own way from one such meeting with a 
              Rheumatologist at age 14. An hour of slow stretching by the fire gave me the deepest sleeps 
              so my family have grown up around me contorted on the floor in peaceful repose. A recent knee 
              operation has bought me down to the mat again with a bang.  Yin has saved me from a stiff knee 
              and early aging.</p>

              <p>I have meditated since I was 18 and for 10 years prior to having my family I 'took vows' in a 
              religious community.</p>

              <p>The combination of mental (spiritual) and physical unwinding which Faye has achieved in her classes 
              at Urban Calm to me is the magic formula. Tissue unwinds when the mind gives it time. The mind first has 
              'to shed that which is no longer useful'. When the 'monkey mind' ceases its constant destructive chatter 
              (I can't do this, I am too old for this, I look silly in this) and focuses  on the breath the breath goes 
              into the cells and cools the heat of the pose. We are after all just atoms of matter with permeable 
              membranes.</p>

              <p>I look forward to growing with all of you as we study Yin further.</p>

            <p>Man can not discover new oceans until he has the courage to lose sight of the shore
               With a change in the wind , one thing led to another and I find myself on board a 25 mt yacht with 
               my life on my back - this being  a backpack chalk full of bikinis and shorts ready for malaysia - 
               and Im setting sail across the big blue sea with four kiwis.</p>            

            <p>We traverse the great Barrier Reef and embrace on our journey across what is known as the Treacherous 
               Tasman to this place they call Dunedin . One jelly fish one flying fish on deck eight whales thirty 
               dolphins one storm five books ten movies and a couple weeks later we cross new Zealand waters through
               cook straight down east coast , through otago harbour and arrive in Dunedin.</p>

            <p>A couple of months later and this californian has settled ashore., making Dunedin my new home.</p>

            <p>I have a love for the ocean nature and animals after growing up in California.</p>
