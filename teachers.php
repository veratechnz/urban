                <p>I have travelled the world more or less since I graduated as a chef at the age of 18 and set 
                sail for Europe at the age of 21. I eventually settled into Yin yoga - there is something about 
                finding and feeling the true depth of your body in a pose that has me hooked. I love what happens
                when we stop pushing and pulling ourselves, not only into poses, but in life.</p>

                <p>During my travels I spent six months in Costa Rica at a temple in the jungle - practising Hatha 
                Yoga, meditating and fasting on Noni Juice – and brown rice. I prepared myself for India through 
                spiritual readings and daily asana practice. I attended a Kriya Yoga initiation with Shibendu 
                lahiri and continued to spend over a month in this incredible city full of temples, holy cows and 
                sacred scents.</p>

                <p>I spent two months at a school called Agama Yoga where we practised Yin style yoga, living in an 
                Ashram where I continued Yogic cleansing of the body, mind and spirit daily. Five years later I was 
                back in the Jungle Temple again and finally undertaking Yoga teacher training Pavones Yoga Centre I spent 
                seven months practising, teaching and studying. My teaching time in Costa Rica was all Karma Yoga and I 
                donated any income I made from my teachings to buying 600 hard wood trees for the land not far from the Centre.</p>

            <p>I'm Kimberley and I am honoured and delighted to be joining Faye at Urban Calm Yin Yoga Dunedin as a teacher 
              in October.</p>

            <p>I am a practising naturopath, massage and bodywork therapist and have had my clinic in Moray 
              Place for 10 years.  I have also studied anatomy and physiology at Otago University and taught at 
              Lotus College of Natural Therapies.  I am crazy passionate about the intelligence of the human body, 
              and working with it to cultivate health, happiness and wellbeing. I have experienced and witnessed 
              the healing that comes about when the body is given what it needs. Meditative practise, bridging mind and 
              body, is an important part of a holistic lifestyle.  This is one of the reasons I am so drawn to yin yoga.</p>

              <p>I first discovered the joy and transformation of yoga 20 years ago, yin yoga specifically 4 years ago.  
              What particularly excites me about yin yoga it how safe and gentle it is, yet so deeply powerful and empowering.  
              It allows us the time and space to listen to self, to our body and it's inner wisdom. I believe this reflective, 
              inward practise is a perfect balm to soothe our busy out-going lifestyles.  Allowing us to come into the simple truth of the moment.</p>

              <p>I am a real newcomer to Yin and was totally hooked from the first day.
              I have had an achy body since I was very young and numerous diagnoses which gave little 
              help to overcoming that. I began to Yin in my very own way from one such meeting with a 
              Rheumatologist at age 14. An hour of slow stretching by the fire gave me the deepest sleeps 
              so my family have grown up around me contorted on the floor in peaceful repose. A recent knee 
              operation has bought me down to the mat again with a bang.  Yin has saved me from a stiff knee 
              and early aging.</p>

              <p>I have meditated since I was 18 and for 10 years prior to having my family I 'took vows' in a 
              religious community.</p>

              <p>The combination of mental (spiritual) and physical unwinding which Faye has achieved in her classes 
              at Urban Calm to me is the magic formula. Tissue unwinds when the mind gives it time. The mind first has 
              'to shed that which is no longer useful'. When the 'monkey mind' ceases its constant destructive chatter 
              (I can't do this, I am too old for this, I look silly in this) and focuses  on the breath the breath goes 
              into the cells and cools the heat of the pose. We are after all just atoms of matter with permeable 
              membranes.</p>

            <p>Man can not discover new oceans until he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.
               With a change in the wind , one thing led to another and I find myself on board a 25 mt yacht with 
               my life on my back - this being  a backpack chalk full of bikinis and shorts ready for malaysia - 
               and Im setting sail across the big blue sea with four kiwis.</p>            

            <p>We traverse the great Barrier Reef and embrace on our journey across what is known as the Treacherous 
               Tasman to this place they call Dunedin . One jelly fish one flying fish on deck eight whales thirty 
               dolphins one storm five books ten movies and a couple weeks later we cross New Zealand waters through
               cook straight down east coast , through otago harbour and arrive in Dunedin.</p>

            <p>A couple of months later and this californian has settled ashore, making Dunedin my new home.</p>

            <p>I have a love for the ocean nature and animals after growing up in California.</p>
